## Entropy Monitor

This tiny application monitors the amount of entropy currently available on a Linux system and displays this value in a small window. The current value and poolsize are pulled from the appropriate entries in `/proc/sys/kernel/random`.

### Requirements

In order to run Entropy Monitor, you will need to install [PyQt5](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download5). It also goes without saying that this application will only run on Linux systems.
